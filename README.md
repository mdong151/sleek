# Submission Notes
- Sometime, 2nd test result could be fail, please help to try to the test run again (I still haven't solve the flakyness issue yet).
- I don't think it makes sense to use scenario outline and Examples keyword in sleek.feature. I changed it so that I can verify monthly Fee table without the need of repeating the test.
- [Test video](https://youtu.be/P3BlUFhKZOI) here.
